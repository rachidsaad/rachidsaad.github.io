				<h2>Festival Details:</h2>
				<p>
					Get ready for an immersive and thought-provoking experience that explores the synergy between the body and cultural expression. Taking place on Thursday, <b>February 27</b>, and Friday, <b>February 28</b>, 2025, the festival offers a diverse array of conferences, live performances, hands-on workshops, and sporting activities.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bringing together Moroccan and international artists and scholars, the festival seeks to deconstruct the body, not merely as a biological entity of flesh and bone, but as a fluid vessel shaped by cultural narratives and representations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The festival, spread across two days, offers a fusion of intellectual exchange and artistic expression, drawing participants from diverse fields. <strong>Day one</strong> opens with a series of thought-provoking presentations, focusing on themes ranging from the body in society to the power of images and movements. Esteemed scholars, such as Professors Cherki Karkaba, Fatima Zahra Salih, and Abderrahmane Ghanimi, lead deep discussions, while engaging workshops and performances follow in the afternoon. From painting to photography and choreography, these workshops provide hands-on experiences for attendees, creating a space where theory meets creativity. The day's events culminate in a film screening and a musical performance, offering a blend of cultural exploration and artistic immersion.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Day two</strong> continues with a robust lineup of talks that explore complex topics such as the body politic, individual liberty, and the impact of capitalism on the human form. Artists, dancers, and sculptors also take center stage, sharing their insights and creative expressions through performances, including the captivating dance pieces "À la découverte du corps inconnu" and "Ce que l'œil a oublié." The afternoon brings an exhilarating outdoor hike, “Corps et âme,” set against the backdrop of Laqsar's picturesque landscape. The festival concludes with a theatrical performance, vibrant choreographies, and an opening to the world during the closing ceremony. Altogether, the festival encapsulates the confluence of art, culture, and intellectual discourse, leaving a lasting impression on all those in attendance.
				</p>
				<p>
					Join us in this celebration of body, culture, and motion, where creativity and scholarly inquiry converge to bring forth new insights into human expression and identity.
